# {metadata.title}

In this chapter, you'll build a Brand Module that adds a `brand` table to the database and provides data-management features for it.

A module is a reusable package of functionalities related to a single domain or integration. Medusa comes with multiple pre-built modules for core commerce needs, such as the [Cart Module](!resources!/commerce-modules/cart) that holds the data models and business logic for cart operations.

You create in a module new tables in the database, and expose a class that provides data-management methods on those tables. In the next chapters, you'll see how you use the module's functionalities to expose commerce features.

<Note>

Learn more about modules in [this chapter](../../../basics/modules/page.mdx).

</Note>

## 1. Create Module Directory

Modules are created in a sub-directory of `src/modules`. So, start by creating the directory `src/modules/brand` that will hold the Brand Module's files.

---

## 2. Create Data Model

A data model represents a table in the database. You create data models using Medusa's data modeling utility, which is built to improve readability and provide an intuitive developer experience.

<Note>

Learn more about data models in [this chapter](../../../basics/modules/page.mdx#1-create-data-model).

</Note>

You create a data model in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `models` directory of a module. So, to create a data model that represents a new `brand` table in the database, create the file `src/modules/brand/models/brand.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/brand/models/brand.ts"
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export const Brand = model.define("brand", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  name: model.text(),
})
```

You create a `Brand` data model which has an `id` primary key property, and a `name` text property.

You define the data model using the `define` method of the `model` utility imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`. It accepts two parameters:

1. The first one is the name of the data model's table in the database. Use snake-case names.
2. The second is an object, which is the data model's schema.

<Note title="Tip">

Learn about other property types in [this chapter](../../../advanced-development/data-models/property-types/page.mdx).

</Note>

---

## 3. Create Module Service

You perform database operations on your data models in a service, which is a class exported by the module and acts like an interface to its functionalities.

In this step, you'll create the Brand Module's service that provides methods to manage the `Brand` data model. In the next chapters, you'll use this service when exposing custom features that involve managing brands.

<Note>

Learn more about services in [this chapter](../../../basics/modules/page.mdx#2-create-service).

</Note>

You define a service in a `service.ts` or `service.js` file at the root of your module's directory. So, create the file `src/modules/brand/service.ts` with the following content:

export const serviceHighlights = [
  ["4", "MedusaService", "A service factory that generates data-management methods."]
]

```ts title="src/modules/brand/service.ts" highlights={serviceHighlights}
import { MedusaService } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Brand } from "./models/brand"

class BrandModuleService extends MedusaService({
  Brand,
}) {

}

export default BrandModuleService
```

The `BrandModuleService` extends a class returned by the `MedusaService` function imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`. This function generates a class with data-management methods for your module's data models.

The `MedusaService` function receives an object of the module's data models as a parameter, and generates methods to manage those data models. So, the `BrandModuleService` now has methods like `createBrands` and `retrieveBrand` to manage the `Brand` data model.

You'll use these methods in the [next chapter](../workflow/page.mdx).

<Note title="Tip">

Find a reference of all generated methods in [this guide](!resources!/service-factory-reference).

</Note>

## 4. Export Module Definition

A module must export a definition that tells Medusa the name of the module and its main service. This definition is exported in an `index.ts` file at the module's root directory.

So, to export the Brand Module's definition, create the file `src/modules/brand/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/brand/index.ts"
import { Module } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import BrandModuleService from "./service"

export const BRAND_MODULE = "brand"

export default Module(BRAND_MODULE, {
  service: BrandModuleService,
})
```

You use the `Module` function imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils` to create the module's definition. It accepts two parameters:

1. The module's name (`brand`). You'll use this name when you use this module in other customizations.
2. An object with a required property `service` indicating the module's main service.

<Note title="Tip">

You export `BRAND_MODULE` to reference the module's name more reliably in other customizations.

</Note>

---

## 5. Add Module to Medusa's Configurations

To start using your module, you must add it to Medusa's configurations in `medusa-config.ts`.

The object passed to `defineConfig` in `medusa-config.ts` accepts a `modules` property, whose value is an array of modules to add to the application. So, add the following in `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "./src/modules/brand",
    },
  ],
})
```

The Brand Module is now added to your Medusa application. You'll start using it in the [next chapter](../workflow/page.mdx).

---

## 6. Generate and Run Migrations

A migration is a TypeScript or JavaScript file that defines database changes made by a module. Migrations ensure that your module is re-usable and removes friction when working in a team, making it easy to reflect changes across team members' databases.

<Note>

Learn more about migrations in [this chapter](../../../basics/modules/page.mdx#5-generate-migrations).

</Note>

[Medusa's CLI tool](!resources!/medusa-cli) allows you to generate migration files for your module, then run those migrations to reflect the changes in the database. So, run the following commands in your Medusa application's directory:

```bash
npx medusa db:generate brand
npx medusa db:migrate
```

The `db:generate` command accepts as an argument the name of the module to generate the migrations for, and the `db:migrate` command runs all migrations that haven't been run yet in the Medusa application.

---

## Next Step: Create Brand Workflow

The Brand Module now creates a `brand` table in the database and provides a class to manage its records.

In the next chapter, you'll implement the functionality to create a brand in a workflow. You'll then use that workflow in a later chapter to expose an endpoint that allows admin users to create a brand.
