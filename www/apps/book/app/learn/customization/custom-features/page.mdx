In the upcoming chapters, you'll follow step-by-step guides to build custom features in Medusa. These guides gradually introduce Medusa's concepts to help you understand what they are and how to use them.

By following these guides, you'll add brands to the Medusa application that you can associate with products.

To build a custom feature in Medusa, you need three main ingredients:

- [Module](../../basics/modules/page.mdx): a re-usable package that defines commerce functionalities for a single domain. It defines new tables to add to the database, and a class of methods to manage these tables.
- [Workflow](../../basics/workflows/page.mdx): a special function that performs a task in a series of steps with advanced features like roll-back mechanism and retry configurations. The steps of a workflow use functionalities implemented by modules.
- [API route](../../basics/api-routes/page.mdx): a REST endpoint that exposes commerce features to clients, such as the admin dashboard or a storefront. The API route executes a workflow that implements the commerce feature using modules.

## Next Chapters: Brand Module Example

The next chapters will guide you to:

1. Build a Brand Module that creates a `Brand` data model and provides data-management features.
2. Add a workflow to create a brand.
3. Expose an API route that allows admin users to create a brand using the workflow.
