In this chapter, you’ll learn how to install and use the Next.js Starter storefront.

## Install Next.js Starter

<Prerequisites items={[
  {
    text: "Node.js v20+",
    link: "https://nodejs.org/en/download"
  },
  {
    text: "At least one region in the Medusa application.",
  },
]} />

1. Clone the `v2` branch of the [Next.js Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa my-medusa-storefront
```

2. Change to the `my-medusa-storefront` directory, install the dependencies, and rename the template environment variable:

```bash npm2yarn
cd my-medusa-storefront
npm install
mv .env.template .env.local
```

3. While the Medusa application is running, start the Next.js storefront:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js Starter Storefront is now running at `localhost:8000`.
