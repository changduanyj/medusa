In this chapter, you’ll learn how to customize the Medusa Admin dashboard.

## What is the Medusa Admin?

The Medusa Admin is an admin dashboard that merchants use to manage their store's data.

You can extend the Medusa Admin to add widgets and new pages. In your customizations, you interact with API routes to provide merchants with custom functionalities.

The Medusa Admin is installed in your Medusa application and runs at `http://localhost:9000/app` when you start the application.

## Example: Create a Widget

A widget is a React component that can be injected into an existing page in the admin dashboard.

For example, create the file `src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx title="src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx"
import { defineWidgetConfig } from "@medusajs/admin-sdk"
import { Container, Heading } from "@medusajs/ui"

const ProductWidget = () => {
  return (
    <Container className="divide-y p-0">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4">
        <Heading level="h2">Product Widget</Heading>
      </div>
    </Container>
  )
}

export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})

export default ProductWidget
```

This inserts a widget with the text “Product Widget” at the beginning of a product’s details page.

In your widget, use custom components from the [Medusa UI package](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui).

### Test the Widget

To test out the widget, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, open a product’s details page in the Medusa Admin. You’ll find your custom widget at the top of the page.
